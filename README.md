# ODSC_East_2019_Deploy_DS_Apps
Slides and Code Samples for ODSC East 2019 Talk on Deploying Data Science Applications

## Notes

**IMPORTANT** - This repo contains all of the application code used for the tutorial but instructions on seting up infrastructure and running the code are still a work in progress. I will be pushing these updates in the next few weeks. Follow me on Twitter at [@GarrettLeeH](https://twitter.com/GarrettLeeH) to stay updated.
